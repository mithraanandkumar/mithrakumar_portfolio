# Part 3

After giving careful thought to the feedback and comments received from different people, I decided that the general American public, students and anti vaccination people will be my targeted audience. I thus concentrated heavily on the following aspects in order to properly communicate my story:

1. Introducing public health to the audience.
2. Historical Markers of public health
3. How does vaccination help in preventing the spread of the disease?
    a. Smallpox 
    b. Polio
    c. COVID-19
4. How has public health helped in improving life expectancy of people?
5. What steps people can take to further public health?

In spite of the fact that the project's scope is fairly vast and there are still many unanswered questions, my main goal in undertaking this project was to concentrate on communicating to my audience what public health is, why is it important and what they can do to better public health.

I wanted to go in depth and give audience information regarding the important historical milestones but based on the feedback I received, I decided to stick to major events that occured through these years. 

Implementing the timeline was tricky. I had used a new tool called visme to create it. Please click [here](https://my.visme.co/view/90o0vd0p-owplnmyzm6x32zd6) to view the visualization.
