# Part I: Final Project

# Outline

This project aims to showcase a birdseye view to the evolution of public health in the world with a special focus on important historical milestones. 

High Level Summary: Focusing on public health leads to healthier lives. 

In order highlight the importance of public health we will consider the following sections:

1. Overall Historical Markers
2. Success of Vaccinations Case Study: Polio
3. Prevention of Infant and Maternal Mortality 

Audience: General Public 

I aim to take my audience through a journey back in time and highlight the major historical markers in public health. I will start by providing an introduction to public health,then walk them through the timeline of historical markers, then focus on just one disease: Polio, then provide evidence about how focusing on public health has resulted in the prevention of infant mortality and maternal mortality, then touch upon COVID-19 and Monkey Pox, and finally concluding by providing recommendations to the audience.
