# Part II

## A. Wireframe/Storyboard

Wireframes for this project are made using index cards. Each card represents one visualization. I have written some text to along with the wireframes to organize my thoughts.

## B. User Research

Audience: US Public (mostly people interested in learning about public health just like me!)

My target audience is the general public. I want to focus on how public health has shaped our society and walk through its importance. Since the scope of this topic is quite broad and to focus on providing more relevant details to the audience, I am continuosly working on finding ways to convey my information with more effective visualizations. Since I want my audience to be more aware of public health and persuade them to take initaitives, I am working on creating a story with persuasive elements embedded in it. 

Questions:

I decided to interview people with the of a survey. The link to the survey can be found [here](https://forms.gle/zr7431WxJ6cd5iRr5). 

The following questions were asked:

1. What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you?
2. What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? 
3. Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?
4. Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct?
5. Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend?

Reflection on Feedback: 
Since I had added a lot of years in the historic milestones, people found it long. Cutting them short and keeping only the important ones will help convey an impactful message. I had hand drawn the graphs and the autheticity of the data was questioned. Since the final story will be presented using shorthand, I will be using data visualization platforms like flourish and tableau to convey my story. People also suggested to include pictures to make it more impactful. Everyone seemed to like the timeline to walk them through all the important milestones. 

## Changes to be implemented:
1. Adding and refining the current visualizations with clearer legends and labels, color scheme.
2. Integrate the changes on shorthand.
3. Using impactful pictures to support the story
