# Part I: Final Project

# Outline

This project aims to showcase a birdseye view to the evolution of public health in the world with a special focus on important historical milestones. 

High Level Summary: Focusing on public health leads to healthier lives. 

In order highlight the importance of public health we will consider the following sections:

1. Overall Historical Markers
2. Success of Vaccinations Case Study: Polio
3. Prevention of Infant Mortality 

Audience: US Public (mostly people interested in learning about public health just like me!)

I aim to take my audience through a journey back in time and highlight the major historical markers in public health. I will start by providing an introduction to public health,then walk them through the timeline of historical markers, then focus on just one disease: Polio, then provide evidence on how focusing on public health has resulted in the prevention of infant mortality and maternal mortality, then touch upon COVID-19 and Monkey Pox, and finally conclude by providing recommendations to the audience.

# Initial Sketches

### Sketch 1: Overall Historical Markers

For this, I wanted to make an interactive timeline which highlights the major historical markers over the years from 5000 BCE to recent years. The draft for this is shown below. Based on the critique I received, I will try to reduce the text information in the chart and make it ineteractive so that when the viewer clicks on the historical event they will be provided with more information regarding the event along with pictures.

### Sketch 2: Success Of Vaccinations Case Study - Polio

For this, I wanted to make a dual axis graph that shows how the increase in vaccinations lead to the decrease in the number of deaths due to Polio (focusing on US). The x-axis would represent the year. The left side y-axis would represent a line graph that portrays the number of deaths due to polio across the years. The right side y-axis would represent a bar graph that shows the number of children vaccinated for Polio.

### Sketch 3&4: Prevention of Infant Mortality

For this, I have used a world map with a sequential color palatte to represent the range of infant mortality rates.

I am also planning on using the infant mortality data for the US across years to sketch a line graph that portrays the trend across the years. This will show how public health interventions have lead to the decline in infant mortality rates.

# Data

To tell this story the following datasets are to be incorporated:

1. [Data1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170188/) - Table Historical Markers and Deutsche Welle Focus: Millennium Development Goals Available [here](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6003071,00.html). The data from these two sources will be used to create the timeline from 5000 BCE to 2011. 
2. For the second sketch, I will be using the following datasets:
            a. [Data2](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910) - This dataset                     contains data on the number of deaths due to Polio in the US from 1910 to 2019. 
            b. [Data3](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination) This dataset shows the global vaccination coverage of one-year-olds with some of the most                important vaccines recommended by the WHO. Data for US can be filtered from this dataset. 
 3. For the thrid and fourth sketch, I plan on using [Data4](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality) dataset. This dataset contains the mortality of infants and children across years for various countries. This datset will be filtered to US for the fourth sketch. 

# Method and Medium

For the implementation of this project, I plan on using Shorthand and data visualization tools like Tableau and Flourish.

Data visualizations like the ones sketched above will be done primarily using Tableau and Flourish. I chose these platforms because of their versatility and ability to create complex graphs in a user-friendly manner. These visualizations will go through multiple iterations based on feedback received from peers.

The project will include a series of wireframes and storyboards made from Balsamiq. These wireframes and storyboards will also be tested and go through multiple changes based on user feedback and peer review. The final website will be completed using Shorthand as the medium.

# Part II

## A. Wireframe/Storyboard

Wireframes for this project are made using index cards. Each card represents one visualization. I have written some text to along with the wireframes to organize my thoughts.

## B. User Research

Audience: US Public (mostly people interested in learning about public health just like me!)

My target audience is the general public. I want to focus on how public health has shaped our society and walk through its importance. Since the scope of this topic is quite broad and to focus on providing more relevant details to the audience, I am continuosly working on finding ways to convey my information with more effective visualizations. Since I want my audience to be more aware of public health and persuade them to take initaitives, I am working on creating a story with persuasive elements embedded in it. 

Questions:

I decided to interview people with the of a survey. The link to the survey can be found [here](https://forms.gle/zr7431WxJ6cd5iRr5). 

The following questions were asked:

1. What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you?
2. What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? 
3. Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?
4. Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct?
5. Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend?

Responses:

Person 1

| Question     | Response |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you? | Well constructed timeline, with significant milestones conveyed. It was exciting to notice the impact public health has had on society and appreciate the same. As a person from healthcare background, the call to action resonated well |
| What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? | Milestones can be further narrowed to public health results, and the impact of vaccinations can be conveyed with even more impact |
| Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?  | The central idea as I understand is understanding the evolution of public health and its success in order to be more responsible, community-driven individuals |
| Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct? | Yes it is clear |
| Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | It is persuasive in it's current form. However, the story needs to further elaborate what the incentives are for people to do their small part in upholding public health initiatives. What is their benefit from being a responsible citizen? |

Person 2

| Question     | Response |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you? | I liked how the wireframes painted a picture of public health over the years. Kind of like a story of how healthcare evolved over the years. I think the numbers and the years really helped. I really liked the graphs that helped visualize the changes. |
| What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? | Everything seemed great. I was just wondering if the graphs are super accurate given that they are hand drawn? Apart from that, everything else is great. |
| Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?  | The central idea in my opinion is the evolution of health and the circumstances that led to all the developments till date. |
| Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct? | Yes. It's clear and the way the dates started from 3000 BC was interesting and informative. |
| Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | I believe it's very persuasive. Don't have any suggestions at the moment. Looks great to me! |

Person 3

| Question     | Response |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you? | Data sharing is interesting and historical information excited me. The graphs speak for themselves. |
| What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? | A bit more clear images of the notes |
| Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?  | The web page centers on Public health |
| Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct? | Yes, the years and periods are mentioned |
| Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | A few pictures may help to attract more attention from the intended audience |



## Reflection on Feedback: 
Since I had added a lot of years in the historic milestones, people found it long. Cutting them short and keeping only the important ones will help convey an impactful message. I had hand drawn the graphs and the autheticity of the data was questioned. Since the final story will be presented using shorthand, I will be using data visualization platforms like flourish and tableau to convey my story. People also suggested to include pictures to make it more impactful. Everyone seemed to like the timeline to walk them through all the important milestones. 

## Changes to be implemented:
1. Adding and refining the current visualizations with clearer legends and labels, color scheme.
2. Integrate the changes on shorthand.
3. Using impactful pictures to support the story.
4. Focus more on incentives for people to volunteer or donate to public health initiatives. Quantify their contributions (how their actions help).

# Part 3

After giving careful thought to the feedback and comments received from different people, I decided that the general American public, students and anti vaccination people will be my targeted audience. I thus concentrated heavily on the following aspects in order to properly communicate my story:

1. Introducing public health to the audience.
2. Historical Markers of public health
3. How does vaccination help in preventing the spread of the disease?
    a. Smallpox 
    b. Polio
    c. COVID-19
4. How has public health helped in improving life expectancy of people?
5. What steps people can take to further public health?

In spite of the fact that the project's scope is fairly vast and there are still many unanswered questions, my main goal in undertaking this project was to concentrate on communicating to my audience what public health is, why is it important and what they can do to better public health.

I wanted to go in depth and give audience information regarding the important historical milestones but based on the feedback I received, I decided to stick to major events that occured through these years. I also recieved feedback to include pictures associated with each event. This was included in the visualization for the historical markers in public health.

Implementing the timeline was tricky. I had used a new tool called visme to create it. Please click [here](https://my.visme.co/view/90o0vd0p-owplnmyzm6x32zd6) to view the visualization.

## Changes made to the initial story

The flow of the story makes much more sense now after implemting the project.

1. I have made my visulaizations much more clearer by including the legends and breif descriptive titles that are more self explanatory.

2. I decided to get rid of a few historical markers from Part 1 based on the feedback received. 

## Design Desicions

1. I have given separate emphasis on the graphs as these are the ones that will support my story - public health initiatives are important and vaccinations help save lives. 

2. I tried creating flow of my story, which starts with introduction, then moving on to the tistorical markers to show the audience why it is important and then about vaccinations (one major chunk of public health) and then lastly what they can do to better public health.

3. I tried to keep all my visualizations consistent throughout the presentation. I chose two contrasting colours pink and blue gray to represent my data.
 
4. I also tried to make the visualizations clear and easy to intepret. This way any person reading my article can understand them without prior context. 

## Observations

I learnt that telling a story through visualizations is a creative and iterative process. All the feedbacks I have received have helped me understand that building a narrative that fits the entire audience is hard, but my creating personas, and mapping a journey helps in understanding who your audience is better. I have also learnt how to use Shorthand effectively. From my topic, I learnt the origins of public health and understood the importance of it. For the collective good health of people, it is very important to take steps that help us prevent another pandemic.
