# Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design

## Introduction

I decided to critique and redesign the visualization called "The World's 25 Largest Banks by Market Capitalization" which can be found in the following link: https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/by-the-numbers_is-switzerland-really-the-country-of-bankers-/40473658

Context:

The article talks about Switzerland's banking indusctry and its working labour force in the financial sector. The paragraph supporting the visaluization talks about how Switzerland's individual banks are no heavyweights in terms of market capitalization in comparison with other countries. 

Why did I choose this visualization?
I chose this visualization bacause at first glance I could not comprehend what the visualization was communicating. I wanted to try and improve the visualization and help other people like me who struggled to understand the graph. 

Views on the Visualization:

It’s a strange design choice. The only thing that worked for me is the labelling, as it is easy to associate the bank with the bar. There are a lot of things that didn’t work for me. 

1. The arrangement is that of a pie chart but the areas are misleading because it's actually a circular bar chart. The use of a pie slice massively distorts/exaggerates the data. 
2. The circular grid line fades away making it difficult to interpret the data for the lower-left bars. 
3. The color coding doesn’t work for me. It is hard to differentiate the color for UK and Switzerland. 

I would choose a better visualization to represent the data either that of a treemap or a horizontal bar chart.

The primary audience for this tool are aspiring bank professionals and economists. The visualization is not effective for reaching that audience. This is because the graph is too fancy for a simple data. It is hard to interpret when the grid lines fade away. It doesn't make sense to use a spiral bar chart when a linear display facilitates more accurate comparisons of the bars. 

The “Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile” method was very helpful in evaluating the data visualization selected. I was able to identify my views on the visualization and formulate few ideas to change the visaluzation. I went through the article to understand the context behind the graph. The graph fails to support the paragraph in terms of highlighting the country the whole article was focused on. I would get rid of the spiral chart and probably use Treemap or Horizontal bar graph to represent the data. I would change the color palette to highlight Switzerland. I would also change the title to support the article. 

Wireframes:

I created two wireframes for my visualization. I created a horizontal bar chart and a treemap.

My thought processs to create this wireframe was to get rid of the spiral chart and create a simple chart to portray the data accurately.

My thought processs to create this wireframe was to show a contarst between Swizerland and the other countries by creating a treemap with sequntial palette to indicate a contrast. 
 
### Testing the solution
I got feedback from 2 people on my wireframe, each of which made me realize different things that I could improve with my visual:

1. Viewer 1 indicated that it would be more useful in terms of understanding to place the more intuitive title instead of "Renting vs Buying" as the main heading at the top along with the areas that specify the renting and buying section on either side of the x-axis, as that's the first thing that gets noticed we see.
2. Viewer 2 indicated that the story that my visual was concentrating on was in which states renting is more preferred than buying and to understand it much better I should use two colors for different areas renting and buying respectively.
3. Viewer 1 also suggested that it might be interesting if I could highlight the states which were neutral and did not have much difference between renting and buying.
4. Viewer 2 gave me a suggestion of instead of using boxes of Rent and Buy on either side of the axis, use a meter which would specify buying on the left side and renting on the right side.
5. Viewer 1 indicated to help understand the context better, sort the bars on the basis of difference in amount.
6. Viewer 2 also indicated that the legends should be added which describes your story and the title.

Answers to some of the other questions that I asked:
1. Both users were able to identify that the plot was aimed towards the general public looking to identify states where renting is preferred than buying.
2. Both users were able to understand the meaning of the visual and the interpretation being derived from them.
 
Based on the feedback provided by the 2 users, I moved on to change my visual accordingly.
