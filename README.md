#Visualizing Government Debt

Data Source:
The data for this assignment was obtained from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The general government debt-to-GDP ratio serves as an indicator of the government finanace's sustainability. 

Visualization: 

The visualization consists of a bar graph which shows the distribution of debt-to-GDP ratio across various countries for a selected year ( I chose to view 2019 data). Countries Germany,Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, USA, and Japan are higlighted with bright colours along with the OECD average. The OECD avearge is colored black to serve as a comparison with the selected countires. The color palette is set to a default palette by the OECD website. 

From the graph, it can be inferred that the debt-to-GDP ratio for Germany and Australia are below average whereas the debt-to-GDP ratio for UK, Canada, USA and Japan are above the avearge.
