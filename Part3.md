# Part 3

After giving careful thought to the feedback and comments received from different people, I decided that the general American public, students and anti vaccination people will be my targeted audience. I thus concentrated heavily on the following aspects in order to properly communicate my story:

1. Introducing public health to the audience.
2. Historical Markers of public health
3. How does vaccination help in preventing the spread of the disease?
    a. Smallpox 
    b. Polio
    c. COVID-19
4. How has public health helped in improving life expectancy of people?
5. What steps people can take to further public health?

In spite of the fact that the project's scope is fairly vast and there are still many unanswered questions, my main goal in undertaking this project was to concentrate on communicating to my audience what public health is, why is it important and what they can do to better public health.

I wanted to go in depth and give audience information regarding the important historical milestones but based on the feedback I received, I decided to stick to major events that occured through these years. I also recieved feedback to include pictures associated with each event. This was included in the visualization for the historical markers in public health.

Implementing the timeline was tricky. I had used a new tool called visme to create it. Please click [here](https://my.visme.co/view/90o0vd0p-owplnmyzm6x32zd6) to view the visualization.

## Changes made to the initial story

The flow of the story makes much more sense now after implemting the project.

1. I have made my visulaizations much more clearer by including the legends and breif descriptive titles that are more self explanatory.

2. I decided to get rid of a few historical markers from Part 1 based on the feedback received. 

## Design Desicions

1. I have given separate emphasis on the graphs as these are the ones that will support my story - public health initiatives are important and vaccinations help save lives. 

2. I tried creating flow of my story, which starts with introduction, then moving on to the tistorical markers to show the audience why it is important and then about vaccinations (one major chunk of public health) and then lastly what they can do to better public health.

3. I tried to keep all my visualizations consistent throughout the presentation. I chose two contrasting colours pink and blue gray to represent my data.
 
4. I also tried to make the visualizations clear and easy to intepret. This way any person reading my article can understand them without prior context. 

## Observations

I learnt that telling a story through visualizations is a creative and iterative process. All the feedbacks I have received have helped me understand that building a narrative that fits the entire audience is hard, but my creating personas, and mapping a journey helps in understanding who your audience is better. I have also learnt how to use Shorthand effectively. From my topic, I learnt the origins of public health and understood the importance of it. For the collective good health of people, it is very important to take steps that help us prevent another pandemic.
