# Part II

## A. Wireframe/Storyboard

Wireframes for this project are made using index cards. Each card represents one visualization. I have written some text to along with the wireframes to organize my thoughts.

## B. User Research

Audience: US Public (mostly people interested in learning about public health just like me!)

My target audience is the general public. I want to focus on how public health has shaped our society and walk through its importance. Since the scope of this topic is quite broad and to focus on providing more relevant details to the audience, I am continuosly working on finding ways to convey my information with more effective visualizations. Since I want my audience to be more aware of public health and persuade them to take initaitives, I am working on creating a story with persuasive elements embedded in it. 

Questions:

I decided to interview people with the of a survey. The link to the survey can be found [here](https://forms.gle/zr7431WxJ6cd5iRr5). 

The following questions were asked:

1. What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you?
2. What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? 
3. Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?
4. Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct?
5. Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend?

Person 1:
Question     | Response
------------ | -------------
What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you? | Well constructed timeline, with significant milestones conveyed. It was exciting to notice the impact public health has had on society and appreciate the same. As a person from healthcare background, the call to action resonated well
What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? | Milestones can be further narrowed to public health results, and the impact of vaccinations can be conveyed with even more impact
Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?  | The central idea as I understand is understanding the evolution of public health and its success in order to be more responsible, community-driven individuals
Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct? | Yes it is clear
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | It is persuasive in it's current form. However, the story needs to further elaborate what the incentives are for people to do their small part in upholding public health initiatives. What is their benefit from being a responsible citizen?

Person 2:
Question     | Response
------------ | -------------
What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you? | I liked how the wireframes painted a picture of public health over the years. Kind of like a story of how healthcare evolved over the years. I think the numbers and the years really helped. I really liked the graphs that helped visualize the changes.
What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? | Everything seemed great. I was just wondering if the graphs are super accurate given that they are hand drawn? Apart from that, everything else is great.
Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?  | The central idea in my opinion is the evolution of health and the circumstances that led to all the developments till date.
Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct? | Yes. It's clear and the way the dates started from 3000 BC was interesting and informative.
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | I believe it's very persuasive. Don't have any suggestions at the moment. Looks great to me!

Person 3:
Question     | Response
------------ | -------------
What worked? What was exciting? And what resonated with you? | Data sharing is interesting and historical information excited me. The graphs speak for themselves.
What didn’t work? Is there anything you would change? | A bit more clear images of the notes
Can you summarize the central idea of the webpage?  | The web page centers on Public health
Do you understand the flow of topics, is the flow of information correct? | Yes, the years and periods are mentioned
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | A few pictures may help to attract more attention from the intended audience



Reflection on Feedback: 
Since I had added a lot of years in the historic milestones, people found it long. Cutting them short and keeping only the important ones will help convey an impactful message. I had hand drawn the graphs and the autheticity of the data was questioned. Since the final story will be presented using shorthand, I will be using data visualization platforms like flourish and tableau to convey my story. People also suggested to include pictures to make it more impactful. Everyone seemed to like the timeline to walk them through all the important milestones. 

## Changes to be implemented:
1. Adding and refining the current visualizations with clearer legends and labels, color scheme.
2. Integrate the changes on shorthand.
3. Using impactful pictures to support the story
