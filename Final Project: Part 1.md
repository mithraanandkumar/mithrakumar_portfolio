# Part I: Final Project

# Outline

This project aims to showcase a birdseye view to the evolution of public health in the world with a special focus on important historical milestones. 

High Level Summary: Focusing on public health leads to healthier lives. 

In order highlight the importance of public health we will consider the following sections:

1. Overall Historical Markers
2. Success of Vaccinations Case Study: Polio
3. Prevention of Infant Mortality 

Audience: General Public 

I aim to take my audience through a journey back in time and highlight the major historical markers in public health. I will start by providing an introduction to public health,then walk them through the timeline of historical markers, then focus on just one disease: Polio, then provide evidence about how focusing on public health has resulted in the prevention of infant mortality and maternal mortality, then touch upon COVID-19 and Monkey Pox, and finally concluding by providing recommendations to the audience.

# Initial Sketches

### Sketch 1: Overall Historical Markers

For this, I wanted to make an interactive timeline which highlights the major historical markers over the years from 5000 BCE to recent years. The draft for this is shown below. Based on the critique I received, I will try to reduce the text information in the chart and make it ineteractive so that when the viewer clicks on the historical event they will be provided with more information regarding the event along with pictures.

### Sketch 2: Success Of Vaccinations Case Study - Polio

For this, I want to show a dual axis graph that shows how the increase in vaccinations lead to the decrease in the number of deaths due to Polio (focusing on US). The x-axis would represent the year. The left side y-axis would represent a line graph that portrays the number of deaths due to polio across the years. The right side y-axis would represent a bar graph that shows the number of children vaccinated for Polio.

### Sketch 3&4: Prevention of Infant Mortality

For this, I have used a world map with a sequential color palatte to represent the range of infant mortality rates.

I am also planning on using the infant mortality data for the US across years to sketch a line graph that portrays the trend across the years. This will show how public health interventions have lead to the decline in infant mortality rates.

# Data

To tell this story the following datasets are to be incorporated:

1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170188/ - Table Historical Markers and Deutsche Welle Focus: Millennium Development Goals Available at: http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6003071,00.html). The data from these two sources will be used to create the timeline from 5000 BCE to 2011. 
2. For the second sketch, I will be using the following datasets:
            a. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910 - This dataset contains data on
            the number of deaths due to Polio in the US from 1910 to 2019. 
            b. https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination This dataset shows the global vaccination coverage of one-year-olds with some of the most important               vaccines recommended by the WHO. Data for US can be filtered from this dataset.
